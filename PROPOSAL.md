For my final project, I want to implement a Cinder version of _Pong_. Everyone
knows the game and the rules are really easy to pick up. Also its famous for being one of the
first video games ever and for that reason I think it'd be a great place to start dabbling
with game development.

The game will offer a bunch of difficulties, be a first to x-wins format, and be played
against the computer. If I have extra time I will add things like powerups which makes the game harder or easier for the user, perhaps some music as well. 
Maybe even some 2 player action although that will have to wait until I get the main functionality working

I'm actual somewhat concerned this is a large undertaking as I haven't really thought
out all of the logic yet behind how I'm going to get it to work. For example how to control the bumpers using a mouse (or should I do it with keyboard controls only?)
Or how to decide the velocity of the ball on impact with a bumper. Things like that.
But I am very much inspired by the ideal gas project that we did which will hopefully give me a lot of pointers on how to get started.

Timeline:

Week 1: Get down general object decomposition and necessary classes for project w/ some features working

Week 2: Have most if not all of the game mechanics implementing + working

Week 3: Work on finishing touches- UI, powerups- if not done yet with Week 2 work
