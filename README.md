Welcome to unfair pong, a spin on the game Pong which we all know.

Control your bumper with the mouse, and first to score five points wins.

There are two gamemodes, five kinds of balls, and four difficulties! See if you can beat them all, but be warned- it gets quite unfair!

(This was a final project for the class CS 126: Software Design Studio at UIUC. The class had a focus on writing clean, robust, and flexible code through object oriented programming concepts)
